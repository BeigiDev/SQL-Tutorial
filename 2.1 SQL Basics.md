## 2.1 SQL Syntax

SQL syntax serves as the foundation for interacting with relational databases. It involves a set of rules and conventions for constructing statements to create, retrieve, update, and delete data. Understanding SQL syntax is essential for effectively working with databases. Here are some fundamental aspects of SQL syntax:

### 2.1.1 SQL Statements

SQL commands are written as statements, which are typically terminated with a semicolon (;). The most common types of SQL statements include:

- **SELECT**: Retrieves data from a database.
- **INSERT**: Adds new records to a table.
- **UPDATE**: Modifies existing records in a table.
- **DELETE**: Removes records from a table.
- **CREATE**: Establishes new database objects (e.g., tables, indexes).
- **ALTER**: Modifies the structure of an existing database object.
- **DROP**: Deletes a database object (e.g., table, index).
- **GRANT**: Provides specific privileges to users or roles.
- **REVOKE**: Removes privileges previously granted to users or roles.

### 2.1.2 SQL Keywords

SQL keywords are reserved words used to construct statements. These words have specific meanings in SQL and should not be used as identifiers (e.g., table or column names). Common SQL keywords include:

- **SELECT**: Used to query data from one or more tables.
- **FROM**: Specifies the table(s) from which to retrieve data.
- **WHERE**: Filters data based on specified conditions.
- **ORDER BY**: Sorts the result set based on one or more columns.
- **GROUP BY**: Groups data for summary or aggregation.
- **JOIN**: Combines data from multiple tables.
- **INSERT INTO**: Adds data into a table.
- **UPDATE**: Modifies existing data in a table.
- **DELETE FROM**: Removes data from a table.
- **CREATE TABLE**: Defines a new table.
- **ALTER TABLE**: Modifies the structure of an existing table.
- **DROP TABLE**: Deletes a table.
- **GRANT**: Provides privileges to users or roles.
- **REVOKE**: Removes privileges from users or roles.

### 2.1.3 SQL Comments

SQL allows for comments, which are not executed and serve as explanatory notes within SQL code. There are two common methods for adding comments:

- Single-line comments using double hyphens (--):
  ```sql
  -- This is a single-line comment
  ```

- Multi-line comments using /* ... */:
  ```sql
  /* This is
     a multi-line
     comment */
  ```

### 2.1.4 SQL Case Sensitivity

SQL is not case-sensitive by default. This means that keywords and identifiers are not affected by letter case. For example, "SELECT" and "select" are treated the same. However, string and character data comparisons might be case-sensitive depending on the database's collation settings.

### 2.1.5 SQL Clauses

SQL statements consist of various clauses that control the statement's behavior. Common clauses include:

- **SELECT Statement Clauses**: These include clauses like WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY, which help specify what data to retrieve and how to present it.

- **INSERT Statement Clauses**: The VALUES clause is used to specify the values to be inserted into a table.

- **UPDATE Statement Clauses**: The SET clause defines which columns to update and the new values.

- **DELETE Statement Clauses**: The WHERE clause specifies the conditions for record deletion.

### 2.1.6 SQL Identifiers

SQL identifiers, such as table names and column names, are used to reference database objects. Key points regarding identifiers include:

- Identifiers can include letters, numbers, and underscores.
- They must begin with a letter.
- Some databases allow double quotes to enclose identifiers, which can include spaces or special characters.
- It's good practice to use meaningful and descriptive names for tables and columns.

### 2.1.7 SQL Data Types

SQL defines various data types to specify the kind of data that can be stored in a column. Common data types include INT (integer), VARCHAR (variable-length character), DATE, TIME, and many more, depending on the database system.

Understanding SQL syntax is crucial for creating accurate and efficient database queries and statements. SQL syntax remains consistent across different relational database management systems (RDBMS) because of ANSI/ISO SQL standards, which ensures portability of SQL code among various database platforms. However, specific databases may introduce extensions or variations to the standard SQL syntax for additional features and optimizations.
